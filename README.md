# Software Installers

These are the installers for all the **Roberto Artigas y Soler** public available MIT softare packages in one convenient location.

Gives you the chance to download just one GitHub repository, install what you choose and try it out.

After that you can go to the specific GitHub repository and install the additional source materials and compile all the specific programs.
Each installer is self contained and normally you will not have to do anything else.

The only consideration for the individual Clarion packages is if you have the correct Clarion version to use the templates or run the compiler.
For the Clarion **template** only packages, the Clarion templates provided will run best on Clarion version 10 or later. 

The additional screen space provided in Clarion version 10 is used for displaying the template.
It will probably work correctly on prevevious releases of Clarion, just the screen will look a bit different on those releases. 
If you have a previous release of Clarion and want to change the screens, you are wellcome to make the changes yourself.

You got all this software for free, you have documentation, so in most cases, there is no addtional support.
If you find errors, let me know, the software will get fixed, as the schedule and time allows.
