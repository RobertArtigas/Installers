# Software Installers

These are the installers for all the **Roberto Artigas y Soler** public available MIT softare packages in one convenient location.

Gives you the chance to download just **one** GitHub repository, install what you choose and try it out.

After that you can go to the specific GitHub repository and install the additional source materials and compile all the specific programs.
Each installer is self contained and normally you will not have to do anything else.

The only consideration for the individual Clarion packages is if you have the correct Clarion version to use the templates or run the compiler.
For the Clarion **template** only packages, the Clarion templates provided will run best on Clarion version 10 or later. 

The additional screen space provided in Clarion version 10 is used for displaying the template.
The templates will probably work correctly on previous releases of Clarion. It is just the template screens will look a bit different on previous releases. 
If you have a previous release of Clarion and want to change the template screens, you are welcome to make the changes to the templates yourself.

**You got all this software for free, you have documentation, so in most cases, there is no additional support.**

Some of these packages have been around for years. A few have been around for one or more decades. There are Clarion groups on Discord. You can ask questions there.
I am available on those groups. Chances there if I am heads down working on something, you will get an answer there from someone or at a latter time I will get to it.
There is also an e-mail you can contact me with. It is published in the templates.

If you find errors, let me know, the software will get fixed, as the schedule and time allows.
**Most of the time, this is the production software that is used when I do changes for myself or my clients.**
If it is not currently being used, it will have changes or fixes made when there is a quiet moment to make the changes.
